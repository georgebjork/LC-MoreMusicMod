# v1.0.0

Inital Release 

# v1.0.1

Added a patch so music now plays in order, so as long as everyone has the music installed, it will play in the same order for everyone.

# v1.0.2

Added a new patch with the help and suggestion of [ANDREJ6693](https://github.com/ANDREJ6693). This patch now includes better mod pack support and better mod manager support. A mod pack can now have the folders `MoreMusic/Music/`. The mod will now search all folders for that specific pattern. If it finds it, it will copy all of songs into a shared folder for the mod to read from.
